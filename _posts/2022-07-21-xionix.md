# Xonix

Xonix is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1984. The game is played on a rectangular grid, where the player controls a marker that moves around the edges of the grid, carving out sections of the playing field. The objective of the game is to claim a certain percentage of the playing field without colliding with enemies, called "gorgons", that move around inside the playing area. The player must also avoid colliding with their own trail, left behind by their marker. The game features multiple levels, with increasing difficulty and more challenging enemies. The game has been ported to numerous platforms, including arcade machines, consoles, and personal computers. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay, along with its colorful graphics and catchy music, have made it a classic that continues to be enjoyed by gamers of all ages.
