# Pong2D
Pong is a classic 2D video game that was first released in 1972. The game is played on a simple rectangular court, with two paddles on either side and a ball that bounces back and forth between them. The objective of the game is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle, scoring points each time the opponent misses the ball.

The player controls their paddle using a simple up-and-down movement, and the ball moves at a constant speed, bouncing off the walls and the paddles. As the game progresses, the ball speed increases, making it more challenging to keep up with and hit.
