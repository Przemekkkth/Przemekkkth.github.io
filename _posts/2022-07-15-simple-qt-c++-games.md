# Simple Qt/C++ games
Hi,
This is first article.  I wrote a few simple games in Qt. List of them:

* **Tetris**

Tetris is a classic puzzle game that was first released in 1984. The game is played on a grid and the objective is to stack falling blocks, known as tetrominoes, in a way that creates complete horizontal lines. As the game progresses, the blocks fall faster and the player must use quick thinking and strategy to keep the game going. The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen. Tetris has been ported to numerous platforms, including arcade machines, consoles, and mobile devices. The game's popularity soared in the late 1980s and early 1990s, becoming a cultural phenomenon. There are many different versions of Tetris, including competitive multiplayer modes and special editions themed around popular franchises. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay has made it a timeless classic that continues to captivate players to this day.

* **Arkanoid**

Arkanoid is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1986. The game is a brick-breaking game, where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and uses it to bounce a ball up towards a wall of bricks. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen. The player can also collect power-ups that fall from the bricks, which can either help or hinder their progress.

* **Snake**

Snake is a classic arcade game that was first released in the late 1970s. The game features a snake, which the player controls, that moves around a game board and eats food, while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it harder to maneuver without running into obstacles or itself.

* **Minesweeper**

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that was first released in the early 1990s. The game is played on a grid of squares, where some squares contain hidden mines. The objective of the game is to clear the board without detonating any mines. The player must click on squares to reveal whether there is a mine or not. If a square does not contain a mine, it will reveal a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.

* **Fifteen Puzzle**

Fifteen Puzzle, also known as the sliding puzzle, is a classic puzzle game that was invented in the late 1800s. The game consists of a square board with 16 numbered tiles, arranged in a 4x4 grid, leaving one empty space. The objective of the game is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in numerical order, from 1 to 15, with the empty space in the bottom right corner. The tiles can only be moved into the empty space by sliding them horizontally or vertically.
