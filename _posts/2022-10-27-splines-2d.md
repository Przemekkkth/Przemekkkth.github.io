# Splines 2D

In two-dimensional computer graphics, splines are a mathematical representation of smooth curves that are used to approximate complex shapes. Splines are a type of interpolation that connects a set of control points with a smooth curve that passes through those points.

There are various types of splines that are commonly used in 2D graphics, such as Bézier curves and cubic splines. Bézier curves are defined by a set of control points, which can be manipulated to adjust the shape and curvature of the curve. Cubic splines, on the other hand, use a series of control points and a set of mathematical equations to generate a smooth curve.

Splines are used in a variety of applications, such as graphic design, computer animation, and video game development. They are often used to create smooth, curved shapes and lines that are difficult to achieve with traditional polygonal modeling techniques. Splines can be used to create anything from simple shapes, such as circles and ovals, to complex curves, such as the contours of a human face. They are particularly useful for creating organic shapes and forms, such as plant leaves, animal bodies, and clouds.
