# Maze Generator

A maze generator is a software program or algorithm that creates random mazes with different shapes, sizes, and complexity levels. The generator typically starts with a grid of cells, and then randomly removes walls to create paths between cells, until a maze is formed. The generated maze can be represented in various formats, such as ASCII characters or graphical images.
