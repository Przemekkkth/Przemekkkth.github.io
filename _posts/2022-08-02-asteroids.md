# Asteroids
Asteroids is a classic arcade game that was first released in 1979. In the game, the player controls a spaceship that must navigate through a field of asteroids, while avoiding collisions and enemy spacecraft. The game is played on a single screen that wraps around, so the player can move in any direction and appear on the opposite side of the screen. The objective of the game is to destroy all the asteroids and enemy spacecraft without getting hit by their projectiles or colliding with them.

The game features different types of asteroids, each with its own size and movement pattern, as well as flying saucers that shoot at the player's ship. The player's ship has a limited supply of fuel and a shield that can absorb a certain amount of damage before being destroyed.


Simple game which is created in Qt/C++ plus physics engine Box2D.
